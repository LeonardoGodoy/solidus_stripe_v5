<!-- Explain what your extension does. -->

## Installation

Add solidus_stripe to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_stripe'
```

> ⚠️ **WARNING** ⚠️
>
> If you need support for `solidus_frontend` please add `< 5` as a version requirement in your gemfile:
>
> `gem 'solidus_stripe', '< 5'`
>
> or if your tracking the github version please switch to the `v4` branch:
>
> `gem 'solidus_stripe', git: 'https://github.com/solidusio/solidus_stripe.git', branch: 'v4'`
>

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bin/rails generate solidus_stripe:install
```

## Usage

<!-- Explain how to use your extension once it's been installed. -->

## Development

Retrieve your API Key and Publishable Key from your [Stripe testing dashboard](https://stripe.com/docs/testing).

Set `SOLIDUS_STRIPE_API_KEY` and `SOLIDUS_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` environment variables (e.g. via `direnv`), this
will trigger the default initializer to create a static preference for SolidusStripe.

Run `bin/dev` to start both the sandbox rail server and the file watcher that will update the sandbox whenever
a file is changed.

Visit `/admin/payments` and create a new Stripe payment using the static preferences.

### Testing the extension

First bundle your dependencies, then run `bin/rake`. `bin/rake` will default to building the dummy
app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using
`bin/rake extension:test_app`.

```shell
bin/rake
```

To run [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis run

```shell
bundle exec rubocop
```

When testing your application's integration with this extension you may use its factories.
Simply add this require statement to your `spec/spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
require 'solidus_stripe/testing_support/factories'
```

Or, if you are using `FactoryBot.definition_file_paths`, you can load Solidus core
factories along with this extension's factories using this statement:

```ruby
SolidusDevSupport::TestingSupport::Factories.load_for(SolidusStripe::Engine)
```

### Running the sandbox

To run this extension in a sandboxed Solidus application, you can run `bin/sandbox`. The path for
the sandbox app is `./sandbox` and `bin/rails` will forward any Rails commands to
`sandbox/bin/rails`.

Here's an example:

```
$ bin/rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 6.0.2.1 application starting in development
* Listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```
